<font size="3"> Our group operates in more than 20 cities, reaching tens of thousands of orders per day. One of main missions as a Catalog Team is to provide to our customers the best experience possible, making sure they see all the important information on the app and get delivered all they asked for, even not having direct contact with them!</font><br><br>

    <strong>Purpose:</strong> this analysis aims to generate insights into the products and services offered by the company. Thus, we will seek answers to questions related to the pattern of consumption and sales in different stores and cities where the services are offered. We will use SQL language to query the database and Python to manipulate and generate views of the data.
